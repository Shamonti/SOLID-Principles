# Medium: Build a Payment system following ISP
# You need to create a payment system with three different payment types:

# CashPayment

# CreditCardPayment

# BitcoinPayment

# Each payment type has different methods:

# Cash needs only pay()

# CreditCard needs pay() + validate_card()

# Bitcoin needs pay() + check_wallet_balance()

# Tasks:

# Design it in a way that no class is forced to implement unnecessary methods.

# âœ… Follow ISP by splitting responsibilities.
